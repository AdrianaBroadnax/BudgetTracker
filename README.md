# BudgetTracker

## db.js

I created a db file and placed it into the public folder.
the the db file, I needed the db to be able to request indexedDB and open budgetDB. 
Next i needed an event to target the store and to create the store. the if its successful you'll be able to check it in the database. 
if an error occur it will pop up in the console log and i will be able to inspect. 
when i input .
the record is suppose to save to the console log so if the user does go offline, the information is still saved. then when you check the database you can get all the transactions. 
in order to get all the transactions successfully we would have posted. 
then if you want to clear the data then that option is availble too. 

the only part I couldnt get was getting the database to show in the local storage but every thing else came up.
